RECENTLY DONE
* membership does not always registers new node 3+
    - issue was related to timinig of gossip, instead of taking update as is, now we're merging items
* fix web_port = 0 when initializing new node
    - when merging nodes, we ensure we update node with port = 0 to proper port
* Implemented delta state
* Implemented record updates via endpoint
* when adding items, ocasionally there is a deadlock
    - issue was with hardcoded web port to 3002 and routing logic issue
* when node is only aware of another node, do not remove it from cluster, try to connect to it indefinitely
* create cli
* make it so client provide a key instead of it being generated
* consider creating cluster config ahead of time instead of forming it on the fly
* partition map does not recalculate to include newly joined node
* rejection join to cluster that is full
* delta propagation seems doing some ping/pong action
    * it seems like the node that sends immediate gossip receives acks properly
        * verify if other nodes only propagate delta through intervals (and if this is intentional), if so see if they are not sending Ack
    * A: this was due to Acks not being always sent if node already received an update from other node
* ensure all web endpoints have proxy
* when item is deleted it does not properly propagate
    * item count should exclude deleted items
* implement proper count
    * each node should gossip partitions and count, partitions should handle deleted items
* add more tests for cluster item count that ensures deleted items are not counted√ü
* implement better interface with Result type
* migrate away from Vnode references to PartitionId
* ensure base64 encoding when returning item
    * add api param to convert bytes to string
* change store implementation to return list of items
    * considerations for sort key / composite key, what order guarantees should we provide
* deleting non existing item return success
    * find other places where hlc is not properly advanced on items
    * find other places where we should first merge with node hlc for deletion 
* nodes do not seem to converge on partition map
* issuing insert command on existing items causes nodes to go into infinite delta send
* attemp to simplify purge_delta_state and clear_delta
    * make sure to consider situations such as concurrent updates to delta state

TODO
* separate CLI into start cluster vs create cluster commands
    * when cluster is created we persist metadata about the cluster
    * persist partition map
* when creating a cluster predefine a partition_map instead of re-calculating on the fly as nodes join
    * as nodes join assign partition map id to node
* ensure when retrieving an item for VNODE we also check active Nodes 
* perf test setup
* delta sync


-----
## Sync

* node joins in JOINED_SYNC mode to random node, node is able to receive updates and sends updates it receives through delta sync from other nodes
* joining node is providing join datetime and maintains information (saving to local file) about the progress (most recent timestamp it had seen). With this information as node is receiving sync data the window of last seen and join date shrinks and eventally node declares it is caught up
* only when node switches to JOINED only then can start receiving requests from clients through API
